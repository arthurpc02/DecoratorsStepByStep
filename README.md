# How it works:
The main idea here is:
We want a function to measure the execution time of other functions.
In this case we want to measure the execution time of the function add().

Read the files from _dec1_ to _dec6_ in order, check the comments and see the features evolving to become a decorator.

All files (from _dec1.py_ to _dec6.py_) output the same results. Except for _dec7.py_ which is a bonus.
